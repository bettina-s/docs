## **Base URL**

The Helo API is built on REST principles. It's using the following base URL:

```text
https://api.helo.com
```

## **Authentication**

To authenticate, you need to add an `Authorization` header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer xxxxx
```

## **Response codes**

To show you if your requests to Helo were successful (or not), we're using standard HTTP codes. 

| **Status** | **Description**                         |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `200`      | Successful request.                     |
| `400`      | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| `401`      | The API key used was missing.           |
| `403`      | The API key used was invalid.           |
| `404`      | The resource was not found.             |
| `429`      | The rate limit was exceeded.            |
| `5xx`      | Indicates an error with Helo servers.   |
