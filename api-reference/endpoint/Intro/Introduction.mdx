## **Base URL**

The Helo API is built on **REST **principles. It's using the following base URL:

```text
https://api.helo.com
```

## **Authentication**

To authenticate you need to add an `Authorization` header with the contents of the header being`Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx`where`re_xxxxxxxxx`is your[**API Key**](https://resend.com/api-keys).

```text
Authorization: Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx
```

## **Response codes**

Resend uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your [requests.In](http://requests.In) general,`2xx`HTTP codes correspond to success,`4xx`codes are for user-related failures, and`5xx`codes are for infrastructure issues.

| **Status** | **Description**                         |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `200`      | Successful request.                     |
| `400`      | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| `401`      | The API key used was missing.           |
| `403`      | The API key used was invalid.           |
| `404`      | The resource was not found.             |
| `429`      | The rate limit was exceeded.            |
| `5xx`      | Indicates an error with Resend servers. |

Check [**Error Codes**](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/errors) for a comprehensive breakdown of all possible API errors.

## **Rate limit**

The default maximum rate limit is**2 requests per second**. This number can be increased for trusted senders by request. After that, youâ€™ll hit the rate limit and receive a`429`response error code.Learn more about our [**rate limits**](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/rate-limit).
